Majority of these customers are liability customers (depositors) with varying size of deposits. The number of customers who are also borrowers (asset customers) is quite small, and the bank is interested in expanding this base rapidly to bring in more loan business and in the process, earn more through the interest on loans. \n","\n","In particular, the management wants to explore ways of converting its liability customers to personal loan customers (while retaining them as depositors). A campaign that the bank ran last year for liability customers showed a healthy conversion rate of over 9% success. This has encouraged the retail marketing department to devise campaigns to better target marketing to increase the success ratio with a minimal budget.\n","\n","The department wants to build a model that will help them identify the potential customers who have a higher probability of purchasing the loan. This will increase the success ratio while at the same time reduce the cost of the campaign.\n","\n","**Dataset Description**:\n","\n","| Feature | Description |\n","| --- | --- |\n","| ID | Customer ID |\n","| Age | Customer's age in completed years |\n","| Experience | # years of professional experience |\n","| Income | Annual income of the customer (In 1,000 dollars) |\n","| ZIPcode | Home address ZIP code |\n","| Family | Family size of the customer |\n","| CCAvg | Average monthly spending on credit cards (In 1,000 dollars) |\n","| Education | Education level: 1: undergrad; 2: Graduate; 3: Advance/Professional |\n","| Mortgage | Mortgage Value of house mortgage if any.
